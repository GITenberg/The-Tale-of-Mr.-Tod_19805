description: "The Tale of Mr. Tod is a children's book written and illustrated by\
  \ Beatrix Potter, first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1912. The tale is\
  \ about a badger called Tommy Brock and his arch enemy Mr. Tod, a fox. Brock kidnaps\
  \ the children of Benjamin Bunny and his wife Flopsy, intending to eat them, and\
  \ hides them in an oven in the home of Mr. Tod. Benjamin and his cousin Peter Rabbit\
  \ have followed Tommy Brock in an attempt to rescue the babies. When Mr. Tod finds\
  \ Brock asleep in his bed, he determines to get him out of the house. His initial\
  \ attempt fails, and the two eventually come to blows. Under cover of the fight,\
  \ the rabbits rescue the baby rabbits. The tale was influenced by the Uncle Remus\
  \ stories, and was set in the fields of Potter's Castle Farm. Black and white illustrations\
  \ outnumber those in colour. The tale is critically considered one of Potter's \"\
  most complex and successful in plot and tone.\"\nPotter's publisher wanted Mr. Tod\
  \ to be the first in a new series of Peter Rabbit tales in larger formats with elaborate\
  \ bindings, but Potter disliked the idea. Nonetheless, Mr. Tod and its 1913 follower,\
  \ The Tale of Pigling Bland, were published in the new formats, but the idea was\
  \ eventually dropped and the ordinary bindings were adopted for reprints. The two\
  \ tales were the last completely original productions by Potter. She continued to\
  \ publish sporadically but used decades-old concepts and sketches rather than new\
  \ images and ideas. In 1995, an animated film adaptation of the tale was featured\
  \ on the BBC television anthology series The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.\n\
