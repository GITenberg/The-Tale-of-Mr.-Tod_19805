<h2>THE TALE OF MR. TOD</h2>


<p>I have made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I
am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy
Brock and Mr. Tod.</p>

<p>Nobody could call Mr. Tod "nice." The rabbits could not bear him; they
could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had
foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 608px;">
<img src="images/image005.png" width="608" height="272" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to
the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard
willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.</p>

<p>In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth
amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/image006.png" width="318" height="255" alt="" title="" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></div>

<p>He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved <i>out</i>; because
sometimes Tommy Brock moved <i>in</i>; (without asking leave).</p>

<p>Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he
grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp
nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging
things up.</p>




<p>His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always
went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was
generally Mr. Tod's.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/image007.png" width="297" height="247" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very
little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He
was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> the wicked
otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine
outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.</p>

<p>He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who
had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that
afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 537px;">
<img src="images/image008.png" width="537" height="234" alt="" title="" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 559px;">
<img src="images/image009.png" width="559" height="239" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes
and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow
burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth&mdash;old Mr.
Bouncer had forgotten them.</p>


<p>He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was
passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for
digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And
the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in
winter&mdash;"I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living
on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!" said
Tommy Brock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 827px;">
<a href="images/image010.jpg"><img src="images/image010_thumb.jpg" width="551" height="461" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy
Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/image011.png" width="316" height="268" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to
taste a slice of seed-cake and "a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip
wine." Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage
leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more
than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and
laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the
cabbage smoke&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>When Flopsy and Benjamin came back&mdash;old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock
and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!</p>

<p>Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the
rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were
round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her
ears, and slapped him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/image012.png" width="346" height="256" alt="" title="" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></div>

<p>Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.</p>

<p>There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark
and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had
rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole
for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the
way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps
showed plainly in the mud.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<a href="images/image013.jpg"><img src="images/image013_thumb.jpg" width="434" height="536" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared;
there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths&mdash;but the smell
that made Benjamin stop, was <i>not</i> the smell of flowers!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/image014.png" width="369" height="312" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.
There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it&mdash;there was smoke
coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick
house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his
foot, and bolted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently
Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there
were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught
on a briar.</p>

<p>Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole
trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was
getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy
the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily
hunting for dandelions.&mdash;"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!"
shouted Benjamin Bunny.</p>

<p>The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/image015.png" width="368" height="314" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat
Ferret?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! He's bagged my family&mdash;Tommy Brock&mdash;in a sack&mdash;have you
seen him?"</p>

<p>"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?"</p>

<p>"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way?
Please tell me quick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/image016.png" width="341" height="289" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were <i>caterpillars</i>; I
did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars."</p>

<p>"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"</p>

<p>"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole
trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning."
Benjamin did so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<a href="images/image017.jpg"><img src="images/image017_thumb.jpg" width="437" height="530" alt="" title="" /></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></div>

<p>"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his
years;" said Peter reflectively, "but there are two hopeful
circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had
refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast."
"Which way?" "Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which
way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr.
Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he
offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be
passing." (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on
the hill).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/image018a.png" width="412" height="303" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was
all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the
hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to
have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.</p>

<p>"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a
nasty person!" said Peter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/image018.png" width="371" height="276" alt="" title="" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></div>

<p>The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way
up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown
little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.</p>

<p>Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether
her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice
while she watched him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with
laughing.&mdash;"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!"
said Benjamin Bunny.</p>

<p>They climbed up and up;&mdash;"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping
out of the hole." "They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their
neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!"</p>

<p>When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went
cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a
crag&mdash;Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep
bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully,
listening and peeping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<a href="images/image020.jpg"><img src="images/image020_thumb.jpg" width="430" height="526" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/image021.png" width="387" height="284" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown
pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.</p>

<p>The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the
kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the
rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.</p>

<p>Benjamin sighed with relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him
shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and
a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.</p>

<p>At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate,
a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair&mdash;in short,
preparations for one person's supper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/image023.png" width="385" height="321" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty
and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their
noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.</p>

<p>Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It
was damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars.</p>

<p>The rabbits shivered in their shoes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them
again!" sighed Benjamin.</p>

<p>They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the
kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open;
the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon
the window-sill.</p>

<p>The room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing;
but they could hear a noise&mdash;a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as
their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that
somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.&mdash;"He
has gone to bed in his boots," whispered Peter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<a href="images/image024.jpg"><img src="images/image024_thumb.jpg" width="434" height="530" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.</p>

<p>Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.
Nothing could be seen of the young family.</p>

<p>The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many
unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried;
rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a
shocking place, and very dark.</p>

<p>They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move
the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail
between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a
light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/image025.png" width="599" height="260" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.</p>

<p>In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and
cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.
But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!</p>

<p>The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a
path of brightness across the dirty floor.</p>

<p>The light showed a little door in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> a wall beside the kitchen
fireplace&mdash;a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that
old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.</p>

<p>And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that
whenever they shook the window&mdash;the little door opposite shook in
answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/image026.png" width="310" height="261" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy
Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.</p>

<p>But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could
not open the window; and although the young family was alive&mdash;the little
rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not
old enough to crawl.</p>

<p>After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They
began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they
might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the
kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was
made of earth or flags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;">
<a href="images/image027.jpg"><img src="images/image027_thumb.jpg" width="546" height="455" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of
stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.
Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn
down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that
it was morning&mdash;sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down
below in the woods.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/image028.png" width="402" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his
ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone
warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white
mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of
a jay&mdash;followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!</p>

<p>Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most
foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short
new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's
kitchen floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of
tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own
fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had
belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been
very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it
had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an
unsatisfactory night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/image030.png" width="388" height="328" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he
tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a
dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.</p>

<p>He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing
unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly
as Tommy Brock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<a href="images/image031.jpg"><img src="images/image031_thumb.jpg" width="430" height="523" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where
Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which
followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded,
warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was
coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head&mdash;Mr.
Tod snapped at it, and barked.</p>

<p>He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He
sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod
had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the
lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door
cautiously and went in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/image032.png" width="446" height="330" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod
furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his
knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he
had left folded up in the dresser&mdash;all set out for supper (or
breakfast)&mdash;without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.</p>

<p>There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
overpowered all smell of rabbit.</p>

<p>But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise&mdash;a deep slow regular
snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.</p>

<p>He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he
turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and
his coat-collar stood on end with rage.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/image033.png" width="418" height="315" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the
house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured
further in&mdash;right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he
scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside&mdash;he did not
like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.</p>

<p>He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.
He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his
walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought
better of it, and took them away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 544px;">
<a href="images/image034.jpg"><img src="images/image034_thumb.jpg" width="544" height="457" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying
a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an
incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he
was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He
stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the
snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It
creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one
eye&mdash;shut it hastily. The snores continued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">
<img src="images/image035.png" width="596" height="253" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed
was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the
window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line
on to the window sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end,
remained in his hand.</p>

<p>Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for
a minute; then he left the room again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There
was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the
house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any
idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/image036.png" width="413" height="310" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and
Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy
Brock's work.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image037.png" width="362" height="305" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and
then tied the rope to a tree.</p>

<p>Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was
puzzled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<a href="images/image038.jpg"><img src="images/image038_thumb.jpg" width="522" height="645" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and
staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.</p>

<p>Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with
the hook&mdash;hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost
apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs
were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.</p>

<p>He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of
the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>(Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house
being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a
blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon
him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!</p>

<p>It seemed as though nothing would waken him&mdash;not even the flapping rope
across the bed.</p>

<p>Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again
with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling
over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath,
worked by a string, through the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/image039.png" width="371" height="314" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy
whiskered)&mdash;he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of
the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.</p>

<p>The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind
legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After
considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.
The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over
the head of Tommy Brock.</p>

<p>Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and
up on the chair.</p>

<p>As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a
milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail
got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop
splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never
moved,&mdash;except one eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 541px;">
<a href="images/image040.jpg"><img src="images/image040_thumb.jpg" width="541" height="644" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/image041.png" width="368" height="308" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of
water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across
the window sill to the tree outside.</p>

<p>"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in
that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort," said Mr. Tod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/image042.png" width="411" height="301" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went
out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his
footsteps over the tunnel.</p>

<p>He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to
let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise," said Mr. Tod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr.
Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail
of water instead of himself, and left the room also&mdash;grinning immensely.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for
the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/image043.png" width="419" height="311" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/image044.png" width="411" height="310" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had
dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to
gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty
minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it
nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>



<p>Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a
pail rolling over and over.</p>

<p>But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened
attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping
from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.</p>

<p>In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened
<i>something</i>&mdash;much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it
(as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket
and it was <i>not snoring any longer</i>.</p>

<p>There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop
drip of water trickling from the mattress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/image046.png" width="384" height="320" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.</p>

<p>Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the
window; but the bundle never moved.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there was no doubt about it&mdash;it had turned out even better than he
had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him
dead!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will
bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun," said Mr. Tod.</p>

<p>"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to
bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be
thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a
hot-water bottle."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/image047.png" width="407" height="311" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda
and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the
smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur."</p>

<p>He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen&mdash;"First I
will arrange the hole&mdash;then I will drag out that person in the
blanket...."</p>

<p>He opened the door....</p>

<p>Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from
Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and
grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 547px;">
<a href="images/image048.jpg"><img src="images/image048_thumb.jpg" width="547" height="455" alt="" title="" /></a>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/image049.png" width="358" height="305" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr.
Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all
over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor
would give way at each crash of falling furniture.</p>

<p>They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and
bushes, listening anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/image050.png" width="389" height="313" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven
woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.</p>

<p>Everything was upset except the kitchen table.</p>

<p>And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen
fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash,
and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.</p>

<p>The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf;
the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of
raspberry jam.</p>

<p>And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/image051.png" width="359" height="307" alt="" title="" />

<div class="figright" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/image052.png" width="424" height="294" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to
be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the
door.</p>

<p>Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the
bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any
love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out
of the bushes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! while I watch
at the door."</p>

<p>But Benjamin was frightened&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"</p>

<p>"No they are not."</p>

<p>"Yes they are!"</p>

<p>"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone
quarry."</p>

<p>Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that
he won't miss them."</p>

<p>Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/image054.png" width="356" height="304" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.</p>

<p>After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a
sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer
could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole;
but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The
day passed heavily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with
a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had
been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her
feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was
wondering anxiously what she would do next.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/image055.png" width="368" height="310" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his
way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the
oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He
lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.</p>

<p>"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?"</p>

<p>Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the
wood.</p>

<p>Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down
Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty
bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit
hole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;">
<a href="images/image056.jpg"><img src="images/image056_thumb.jpg" width="504" height="623" alt="" title="" /></a>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 369px;">
<img src="images/image057.png" width="369" height="310" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and
Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies
were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They
soon recovered.</p>

<p>A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to
Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/image058.png" width="357" height="251" alt="" title="" />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
